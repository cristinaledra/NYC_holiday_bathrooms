			<h2>His top issue is the environment</h2></!-->
			<p> The fight for more public bathrooms in New York City has gone on for decades, but no such time is the problem more exacerbated than during the busy holiday season when millions of visitors flock to two of the city’s biggest attractions – the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and Bryant Park’s Winter Village. </p>

<p>Organizers estimate that 125 million people visit the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree per year, while around three million attend Bryant Park’s Winter Village. While it would be difficult for any number of public bathrooms to accommodate that many people, there are still very few options within a five minute walk of either attraction. 
</p>

</script>
		</p>

<p>In addition to the low number of bathrooms available, the hours of operation can also be an issue. By Rockefeller Center, the three options within a five minute walk are the 53rd public library, and two privately owned public spaces (POPS). The library is open until 6 p.m. six days a week and is closed on Sundays. The POPS at 645 Fifth Ave. is open every day but closes at 10 p.m., and the POPS at 575 Fifth Ave. is open every day until midnight. This leaves fewer public options in the evening hours and on Sundays, and no options after midnight.</p>

<p>The situation is similar by Bryant Park, where the park’s famous public restrooms close at 10 p.m. every day. The other two public restrooms within a five minute walk are located in libraries, which are not open on Sundays, and have varying closing hours depending on the day. The earliest closing time is 5 p.m. and the latest is 9 p.m.
</p>

<p>Advocates say these facilities are not adequate for the number of residents in New York City, much less the tourists that flock to the city throughout the year.</p>

<p>“There are some people who think, ‘Well, if you need a bathroom, you can just go into a restaurant.’ That’s actually not true for everyone,” Alison Wilkey, the director of government affairs at Coalition for the Homeless <a href="https://citylimits.org/2024/06/07/nyc-plans-to-expand-public-restrooms-will-it-benefit-homeless-new-yorkers" target="_blank">told City Limits.</a> “One, a lot of places require that you make a purchase, and two, there are definitely racial differences in how people are perceived when they walk in and ask for a bathroom.”
</p>

<p>Although Mayor Eric Adams announced his <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/441-24/mayor-adams-launches-ur-luck-new-effort-make-nyc-public-restrooms-more-accessible-#/0" target="_blank">“Ur In Luck” initiative</a> in June, the 46 new public restrooms and 36 renovated restrooms in the next five years promised in the bill are not enough, Wilkey said. 
</p>

<p>“It’s great that we are building more bathrooms, but bathrooms take time to build,” Wilkey said. “The city could take an additional step right now to make more bathrooms available by opening up bathrooms in government buildings.” </p>
<p>As part of the Ur in Luck initiative, the city created a Google Maps layer that anyone can download to find the nearest public restroom, but at certain hours, visitors to the midtown holiday attractions might have to rely on the giving spirit of private businesses if they need to use the restroom.

			<h2>He is a strong proponent of congestion pricing</h2>
			<p>
				Although the implementation of congestion pricing aims to reduce traffic in Manhattan, which proponents say would have a positive impact on air quality, Hoylman-Sigal brought forth another argument in its favor. He produced a report with Sam Schwartz (Gridlock Sam) that painted the need for congestion pricing as a life or death issue because of response times of emergency vehicles. </p>
				<p>In the report, he wrote about his experience calling 911 for a man in pain in Chelsea and waiting 37 minutes for an EMT to arrive. He also included data showing that traffic in the city’s central business district has slowed over the past decade to record lows and that emergency response times have lengthened in that time.

			<h2>He is against shelter limits for migrants</h2>
			<p>
				In an op-ed for City & State with state assemblywoman Catalina Cruz and advocate Christine Quinn, Hoylman Sigal came out against the Adams Administration’s 30- and 60-day shelter limits for migrant single adults and families, calling the policy unjustifiable and inhumane.</p> 

<p>“The idea that the 30 and 60-day rules are helping our newest arrivals ‘find their footing in New York’ is farcical,” the op-ed read. “These policies have the opposite effect, forcing migrants into a cycle of evictions that leave them in a permanent state of precarity. For families with children, moving from one shelter to another every 60 days means children miss school and switch between multiple institutions throughout the school year, leading to significant learning disruptions and psychological trauma.”

			<h2>He co-sponsored the Adult Survivors Act</h2>
			<p>
				Hoylman-Sigal and state assemblymember Linda Rosenthal sponsored the bill, which removed the statute of limitations on civil actions related to adult survivors of certain sexual offenses. Before it was signed into law in 2022, the statute of limitations was three years.

			</p>
			<p>
			Several high-profile civil cases were filed as a result of the legislation, including those against Sean “Diddy” Combs, former governor Andrew Cuomo, mayor Eric Adams, musician Axl Rose, and actors Jamie Foxx and Cuba Gooding Jr.

		<h2>He wants to help local journalism</h2>
			<p>
				Hoylman-Sigal has <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S625/amendment/B" target="_blank">sponsored a bill</a> to give a one-year payroll tax credit to employers for the compensation of journalists, with set maximums for employers and amount of credit. The bill is with the senate Budget and Revenue Committee.
